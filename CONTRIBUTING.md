# Datenstrom contributing guidelines

Here's a quick overview of our guidelines:

- Imagine what would make life easier, if you want to work with us.
- Write the question in the title, if you want to ask a question.
- Explain how to reproduce the bug, if you want to report a bug.

Work with us, ask questions, report bugs and share your experiences. We are interested in what you want to do and which problems you have. The more we know the better we can help. Our community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you.
