# Datenstrom contributing guidelines

Work with us, ask questions and report bugs. We are interested in what you want to do and which problems you have. The more we know, the better. Our community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use an online translator if English is not your first language.
